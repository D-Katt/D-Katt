### About me
My name is Ekaterina. I have been studying and practicing ML, deep learning and data analysis for the last three years.

I have an extensive experience working in real estate consulting and appraisal industry as an analyst and marketing specialist. In addition to coding and ML experiments, I can handle a wide range of tasks from market research to financial analysis to project management.

I worked on problems related to time series, tabular, image and text data and would be interested in projects related mostly to processing tabular and image data. I use standard ML stack (sklearn, gradient boosting). In neural networks domain I prefer working with TensorFlow.

You can find me active on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ekaterinadranitsyna) and at [TensorFlow forum](https://discuss.tensorflow.org/u/Ekaterina_Dranitsyna), where I engage in discussions and help solving basic questions about neural networks.

Here is a link to my Google developer profile: g.dev/dranitsyna. In 2021 I received a TensorFlow Contributor Award:
